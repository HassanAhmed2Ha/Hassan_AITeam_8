# Hassan Ahmed - Hassan_AITeam_8

Welcome to my GitHub repository, **Hassan_AITeam_8**. 

## About Me
I am an undergraduate student at the **Faculty of Agriculture, Alexandria University**, with a deep passion for the intersection of biology, data, and technology. My core interests lie in **Data Science, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning**. 

I believe in continuous learning and building strong foundational knowledge before jumping into ready-made tools. Currently, I am:
* Exploring advanced AI concepts, RAG agents, and hardware for TinyML.
* Expanding my data visualization toolkit, including working with Power BI.
* Enhancing my technical and global communication skills (studying English for IT and currently learning Spanish).
* Honored to be nominated for the 2026 Mozilla Fellowship and actively pursuing global educational opportunities.

## About This Repository
**Hassan_AITeam_8** serves as a central hub and portfolio for my AI and Data Science training tasks. It documents my journey in learning the core mathematical and programming foundations required for the AI field.

### Featured Content: Hello IEEE Task
Currently, this repository hosts my work on the **Hello IEEE** project, which is divided into:
1. **Mathematical Research:** Deep dives into the Trapezoid Rule for integration and the mathematical logic behind Min-Max Matrix Normalization for AI applications.
2. **From-Scratch Programming:** A pure Python implementation of a Matrix Calculator. This includes Matrix Summation, Subtraction, Dot Product Multiplication, Scalar operations, and Normalization—built entirely without external libraries to solidify my understanding of nested algorithms and linear algebra logic.

## Let's Connect
I am always open to discussing data science, bioinformatics algorithms, or exciting new tech opportunities. Feel free to explore my work and reach out:
