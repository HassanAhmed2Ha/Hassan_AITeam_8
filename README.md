# Hassan Ahmed - Hassan_AITeam_8

Welcome to my GitHub repository, **Hassan_AITeam_8**. 

## About Me
I am an undergraduate student at the **Faculty of Agriculture, Alexandria University**, with a deep passion for the intersection of biology, data, and technology. My core interests lie in **Data Science, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning**. 

I believe in continuous learning and building strong foundational knowledge before jumping into ready-made tools. Currently, I am:
* Exploring advanced AI concepts, RAG agents, and hardware for TinyML.
* Expanding my data visualization toolkit, including working with Power BI.
* Enhancing my technical and global communication skills (studying English for IT and currently learning Spanish).
* Honored to be nominated for the 2026 Mozilla Fellowship and actively pursuing global educational opportunities.

## About This Repository
**Hassan_AITeam_8** serves as a central hub and portfolio for my AI and Data Science training tasks. It documents my journey in learning the core mathematical and programming foundations required for the AI field. This space will continue to grow as I tackle more complex challenges and share my progress in the world of Artificial Intelligence.
