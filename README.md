# Hassan Ahmed - Hassan_AITeam_8

Welcome to my GitHub repository, **Hassan_AITeam_8**. 

## About Me
I am an undergraduate student at the **Faculty of Agriculture, Alexandria University**, with a deep passion for the intersection of biology, data, and technology. My core interests lie in **Bioinformatics, Data Science, and Ethical AI Research**. 

I believe in continuous learning and building strong foundational knowledge before jumping into ready-made tools. Currently, I am:
* Exploring advanced AI concepts, RAG agents, and hardware for TinyML.
* Expanding my data visualization toolkit and learning technical IT English and Spanish.
* Honored to be nominated for the 2026 Mozilla Fellowship and actively pursuing global educational opportunities.
* Working as a Research Cohort Member at Misr El Kheir Foundation (MEK) focusing on research methodology and academic writing.

## About This Repository
**Hassan_AITeam_8** serves as a technical hub for documenting my progress in AI and Data Science. It acts as a portfolio for training tasks, where I apply mathematical foundations and programming logic to solve complex problems, bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation.

## Let's Connect
